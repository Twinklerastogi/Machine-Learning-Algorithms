# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Implementation of the most popular machine learning algorithms and learn how they learn from data and how they make predictions. We will also discuss how the concept of model complexity plays out for each of these models.

## Supervised Machine Learning Algoriths
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Linear Models
* Naive-Bayes Classifiers
* Decision Trees
* Ensembles Decision Trees
* Kernelized Support Vector Machines
